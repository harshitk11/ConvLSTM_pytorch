# ConvLSTM_pytorch
Implementation of ConvLSTM with multi-layer and stateful support.

Inspired from [this](https://github.com/ndrplz/ConvLSTM_pytorch) repository. Added detailed comments and support for stateful implementation. Used for implementing the baseline for spatio-temporal prediction in the paper: [Unsupervised Hebbian Learning on Point Sets in StarCraft II](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9892259)
